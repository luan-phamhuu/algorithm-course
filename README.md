<!-- compile code with: -->
<!-- g++ -pipe -O2 -std=c++14 <filename> -lm -->

<!-- If your C/C++ compiler does not recognize the "-std=c++14" flag, try replacing it with "-std=c++11" or "-std=c++0x" flag or compiling without this flag at all (all starter solutions can be compiled without it). On Linux and MacOS, you probably have the required compiler. On Windows, you may use your favorite compiler or install an environment such as cygwin. -->
